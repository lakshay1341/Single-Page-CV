# Single-Page CV Project

Welcome to my single-page CV project! This project demonstrates how to create a structured, single-page CV using only HTML.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to teach you how to create a clean, semantic layout for a CV. This project focuses on the structure and content, with styling to be added in a future project.

## Key Features

- **Structured Layout**: Organized sections for education, skills, and career history.
- **Semantic HTML**: Use of appropriate HTML tags to ensure the document is easily understandable.
- **SEO Principles**: Basic SEO practices applied to make the CV more discoverable.

## Getting Started

To view the CV, simply open the `Single-Page_CV.html` file in your web browser.

## Future Enhancements

- **Styling with CSS**: In a subsequent project, we will add styling to enhance the visual appeal of the CV.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the CV looks great on all devices.
